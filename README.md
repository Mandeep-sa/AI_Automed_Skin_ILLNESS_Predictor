# AI_Automed_Skin_ILLNESS_Predictor

Problem Statement- Skin diseases are on a rise in India and lack of knowledge and medical facilities specially in rural areas affect early detection of these diseases resulting in adverse conditions at the later stages. People either do not have access to required medical facilites or they restrain themselves due to costly procedures.

Solution- This project aims to solve this problem by detecting various Skin Diseases using Convolutional Neural Network framework in Machine Learning. I used HAM10000 dataset which is the most extensive dataset available on this topic consisting of 10,000 images.
